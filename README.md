# Near To Me
This project was a team project from Business College Helsinki with 4 members in collaboration with a CGI product owner.  
We used Scrum and the project was split into 4 sprints with duration of 2 weeks each and each sprint had a different Scrum Master.  
Near to Me is a tourist app showing Helsinki's places, activies and events fetched from the ~~MyHelsinki Open API~~ local JSON sorted by distance.  
MyHelsinki Open API was discontinued so i had to switch this project to local JSON to work.
